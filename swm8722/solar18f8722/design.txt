Hardware and software design:
/*
 * This program controls and monitors solar power battery arrays on a 12vdc system
 * MBMC uses a simple expert machine to try and keep current the energy stored in a bank of batteries
 * The main physics functions are contained in the noload_soc, update_cef, ChargeBatt and pick_batt functions
 * Much work is needed to make the program flow logical but making it work first is the current effort
 * The network interface processor on a pic32 will be able to analyze the collected data for better control at some future point
 *
 * standard program units:
 * Voltage  in (unsigned long/unsigned int) millivolts,
 * Current in (long) tenths of amps
 * Watts Power in (unsigned long)
 * Ah battery capacity (unsigned long) milliAh when in 32 bit variables/ (int) tenths of Ah when in 16 bit variables for net in/out Ah balance usage h[0],h[6]
 *
 * R: structure, real values from measurements
 * C: structure, calculated values from measurements or programs
 * B: structure, battery parameters
 *
 * USART2 		is the host comm port 38400
 * USART1		MBMC host network 38400
 * Timer0		1 second clock
 * Timer3		work thread , background I/O clock ~20HZ
 * Timer2
 * 0..11 analog channels are active
 * PORTA		analog inputs
 * External ADC voltage ref on ana3
 * adc0	systemvoltage			PIC Controller supply voltage to 5VDC regulator
 * adc1	ccvoltage				Charging voltage at battery from CC
 * adc2	currentin				50A AMPLOC sensor input from PV array
 * adc11 rawp1/inputvoltage		Voltage from PV array, cal is still on ana3 slot
 * adc4	rawp2/primarypower[B1]	Voltage a primary inverter battery
 * PORTB		external control i/o
 * PORTC0		C40 charge controller led input
 * PORTD		switch input
 * PORTE		battery/charge relays
 * PORTF						analog inputs
 * adc5	current					300A AMPLOC sensor battery output to inverter
 * adc6 rawp3/primarypower[B2]	Voltage for backup battery
 * adc8 currentcharger 			50A AMPLOC sensor on 15vdc 10A ps for external charger.
 * adc9 thermo_batt				thermistor input 10K at 25C RF4
 * adc10 Ground REF				zero adc charge cap
 * adc_cal[10-13]				current sensors zero offset stored in eeprom 10=a50, 11=a50c, 12=a300, 14=future
 * cal table 98,123,ADC_NULL,161,119,ADC_NULL,ADC_NULL,ADC_NULL,ADC_NULL with checksum as last data item in adc_cal[]
 * PORTH0		run flasher led onboard.
 * PORTJ		load/input relays
 * PORTG		high current battery load
 * 4x20 LCD status panel and led status lights.
 * currentload					The current going the power the inverter or other load.

Edit xlcd.h for correct pin I/O
BE SURE to include all XLCD files to compile your versions with the correct ports defined

C18 3.40
C32 2.02
Preserve EEPROM on Program

Track total current in and out between charges. measure start of charge to float
to tune CEF and battery health.

MPLABX 2.20 is the IDE for all software

The PIC32 host now has a telnet server to connect to the SOlar controller serial command port
