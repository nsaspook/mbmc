			<h2>Implementation</h2>
			<p>
				As HTML in itself doesn't include any functionality for drawing the only
				kind of chart that can easily be made is the bar chart. Stretching an
				image, or a block container (such as a div), to a certain width will
				accomplish that. Creating line, area and pie charts though is a bit
				trickier.
			</p>
			<h3>Drawing</h3>
			<p>
				With the release of Internet Explorer 5 Microsoft introduced an API for
				drawing vector graphics, called VML. Erik wrote the
				<a href="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/VMLClock/clock.html">VML Clock</a>
				article shortly after it's release to showcase it, however it's seen
				little coverage and hardly any deployment.
				(<a href="http://www.bindows.net/">Bindows</a>™, the company where
				Erik used to work, actually does use VML in a few of their components,
				such as charts and gauges).
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the reasons VML has hardly seen any use is because it's IE only
				and most people have been waiting for SVG. Which has been under way for
				several years now but only recently where added to the  default Mozilla
				builds and Opera. To make matters worse it seems IE will not be getting
				native SVG support anytime soon.
			</p>
			<h3>Canvas</h3>
			<p>
				Early last year Apple introduced
				<a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Drawing_Graphics_with_Canvas">Canvas</a>,
				yet another technology for drawing, in their Safari web browser.
				Unlike SVG and VML it's based on pixels rather than vectors. While this
				might seems inferior it's actually very suitable for drawing fixed size
				2D graphics, such as charts and graphs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since being introduced by Apple support for it has been added both to
				Mozilla and Opera, making it available in all major web browser but IE.
			</p>
			<p>
				My original plan was to create the Chart component to use different
				painters depending on the browser, that way VML could be used in IE and
				Canvas or SVG in all other browsers. That's also how I built it, but at
				the time the API and the Canvas painter implementation where complete the
				<a href="http://me.eae.net/archive/2005/12/29/canvas-in-ie/">IECanvas</a>
				emulation project I've been working on had come far enough to allow the
				Canvas implementation to be used in IE as well.
